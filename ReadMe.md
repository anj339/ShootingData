## NBA Shooter Data Analysis 2021 Season

This README provides an overview of the analysis performed on NBA shooting data from the 2021 season. The analysis aims to evaluate shooting performance by calculating shooting percentages, distances, and success rates for each player.

#Overview

This analysis explores the shooting performance of NBA players by evaluating shooting percentages at various distances from the basket. The goal is to identify which shooting ranges are most effective for each player and to provide insights into their overall shooting efficiency.

#Data Preparation
Ensure you have the following data:

Player Shooting Data: Includes player names, shot distances, shot attempts, and shot outcomes (made or missed).

Shot Locations: Data on the specific locations of each shot.

#Calculations

Shooting Percentage by Distance

Calculate Shooting Percentage by Distance:

Determine the shooting percentage for each distance from the basket.

#Distance from the Basket

Calculate Distance from the Basket:

Use the shot location data to compute the distance for each shot.

Distances can be calculated using coordinate data (e.g., Euclidean distance).

#Best Shooting Range for Each Player

Find the Range with the Highest Shooting Percentage for Each Player:

Group shooting percentages by distance ranges (e.g., 0-5 feet, 5-10 feet, etc.).

Identify the range where each player has the highest shooting percentage.

#Shooting Percentage by Range

Calculate Shooting Percentage for Each Player in Each Range:

Compute the shooting percentage within predefined distance ranges for each player.

#Made Shots and Shot Attempts

Calculate the Number of Made Shots and Total Shot Attempts for Each Player:

Aggregate the total number of made shots and shot attempts for each player.

#Field Goal Percentage (FG%)

Display the FG% for Each Player:

Present the overall field goal percentage for each player.

#Success Rate by Shot Location

Calculate the Success Rate for Each Shot Location:

Analyze success rates for specific shot locations or zones on the court.
